It's remarkable how far technology has advanced since I last started blogging. A decade ago, I would be furiously tinkering with my web server running Wordpress just so I can put out thoughts that in retrospect, were worth less than the effort put into learning how to get the server running.

Now with GitHub, I can deploy a blog in 1/10 of the time I would be spending tinkering with Wordpress and databases, with all the features that truly matter for me. Wordpress will probably be the preferred platform if you have a need for a website with multiple authors, and the mindshare of developers ready to provide you with a plugin for just about any feature you can think of for a modern website.

However, there will always be a place on the web where the only thing that matters to the creator are the words.

This site will serve as a repository of notes for future reference because the human brain has to forget certain details over time to remain optimally functional. I hope my tiny contribution to the Internet resulting from my physical inability to upgrade my biological storage will aid you, dear traveler, in your tech journey as well.
