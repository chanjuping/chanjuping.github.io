UPDATED 2022-04-04: Adding additional options for Magic Cookies

I added the following to my `.bashrc` file because it would allow me to easily execute x11vnc on my Raspberry Pi when I need to do screen sharing sessions while teaching, whatever the desktop environment.

```shell

function xi3() {
        tmux new -d -s vnci3
        tmux send-keys -t vnci3 "x11vnc -display :0 -forever -rfbauth /home/$USER/.vnc/passwd -wait 50 -noxdamage" ENTER
}

```

The code above creates a function `xi3` which creates a new tmux session named `vnci3`, which launches x11vnc with some user specific options.

If you are using the code snippet above, make sure you have already executed `x11vnc -storepasswd` to create a user password in `/home/$USER/.vnc/passwd`.

The reason why I am not running the command as a systemd service is because I do not need to have the vnc server running all the time, and this particular setup is for when I am using the i3 desktop environment in combination with any other distro using X instead of Wayland.

# UPDATE 2022-04-04

Since writing this post last year, I have switched to running openSUSE Tumbleweed on my Raspberry Pi 4. There were some quirks to work around that took me a bit of time to resolve. Following the trail of a specific error message brought me to [this helpful post](https://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/565024-Help-locally-displaying-KDE-desktop-via-x11vnc-piped-through-ssh-from-Tumbleweed-headless-remote-PC/page2) on the openSUSE forums where I learnt SDDM generates a random name to store a credential known as a magic cookie, and this filename changes after every reboot.

The path to this magic cookie file can be found with the command:

`systemctl --user show-environment  | grep XAUTHORITY= | cut -d'=' -f2`

I experimented with, and got my function to store the path to the randomly generated file to a variable, which is then referenced using the `-auth` option in x11vnc.

This new command is working on my Tumbleweed powered Raspberry Pi now!

```shell

function xi3() {
        tmux new -d -s vnci3
        magic_cookie=`systemctl --user show-environment  | grep XAUTHORITY= | cut -d'=' -f2`
        tmux send-keys -t vnci3 "x11vnc -auth $magic_cookie  -display :0 -forever -rfbauth /home/$USER/.vnc/passwd -wait 50 -noxdamage" ENTER
}

```
