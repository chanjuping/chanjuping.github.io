title: "Launching x11vnc to a New tmux Session"

I added the following to my `.bash.rc` file because it would allow me to easily execute x11vnc on my Raspberry Pi when I need to do screen sharing sessions while teaching, while it is running Ubuntu with the i3 desktop environment.

'''shell

function xi3() {
        tmux new -d -s vnci3
        tmux send-keys -t vnci3 "x11vnc -display :0 -forever -rfbauth /home/$USER/.vnc/passwd -wait 50 -noxdamage" ENTER
}

```

The code above creates a function `xi3` which creates a new tmux session named `vnci3`, which launches x11vnc with some user specific options.

If you are using the code snippet above, make sure you have already executed `x11vnc -storepasswd` to create a user password in `/home/$USER/.vnc/passwd`.

The reason why I am not running the command as a systemd service is because I do not need to have the vnc server running all the time, and this particular setup is for when I am using the i3 desktop environment, or any other non-Ubuntu distro using X instead of Wayland.
